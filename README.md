# OBSControl

This application is for people who record their BeatSaber gameplay using OBS. It connects to [HttpStatus](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status/) to detect the current game-state and [obs-websocket](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/) to automatically start and stop the recording.

Files are saved where-ever you set your output folder to in OBS.

**If you have encountered any bugs or issues with this application, feel free to create an issue with your problem.**

**If you want to get it fixed faster or it's something urgent, you can join [my Discord](https://discord.gg/gzEjZE9Mre) and hit me (`Fab#5555`) with a ping.**

## OBSControl not connecting?

**AVG Antivirus is known to cause all kinds of issues** with connection-related things. (Credit to `Arro#6969` to help me discover this issue! <3)

If you have AVG Antivirus installed, please uninstall it and find a better antivirus solution.

If you ruled out your antivirus (through uninstalling it or deactivating it's protection), just create an issue or join my Discord like mentioned before.
