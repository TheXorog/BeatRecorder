## Important info regarding OBS Websocket 5.x.x

**OBS Websocket 5.X.X is currently not supported. Please download and use [4.9.1](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases/tag/4.9.1) for now.** 5.x.x support will be added soon, so stay tuned for that.

## What is this?

This application is for people who record their BeatSaber gameplay using OBS. It connects to **[beatsaber-http-status](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status/)** or **[BSDataPuller](https://github.com/kOFReadie/BSDataPuller)** to detect the current game-state and **[obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases/tag/4.9.1)** to automatically start and stop the recording.

Files are saved where-ever you set your output folder to in OBS.

**If you have encountered any bugs or issues with this application, feel free to create an issue with your problem.**

**If you want to get it fixed faster or it's something urgent, you can join [my Discord](https://discord.gg/gzEjZE9Mre) and hit me (`Fab#5555`) with a ping.**


## Requirements

* **[beatsaber-http-status](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status/)** or **[BSDataPuller](https://github.com/kOFReadie/BSDataPuller)**
<br></br>
* **[obs-websocket](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/)**

## How to set up

1. Install all the previously mentioned dependencies.
2. Download and unzip this application.
3. Run it once, it'll ask you to input your Settings. Do so.
   1. **If you want to use BSDataPuller instead of beatsaber-http-status, set `Mod` to `datapuller` and change the `BeatSaberPort` to the port that datapuller uses (Default: `2946`)**
4. After configuring, close notepad and check if the applications starts up.
5. Profit

## Config Help

* `README` - This really just redirects you here for help.
<br></br>
* `ConsoleLogLevel` - The log level displayed in the console. I recommend leaving that alone.
<br></br>
* `Mod` - The mod you want to use to connect to Beat Saber. (`http-status`, `datapuller`)
* `BeatSaberUrl` - The IP/URL you use to connect to Beat Saber. Leave at default if you don't know any better.

* `OBSPort` - The IP/URL you use to connect to the OBS-WebSocket. Leave at default if you don't know any better.

* `AskToSaveOBSPassword` - This specifies if you want BeatRecorder to ask for a password. 
* `DisplaySteamNotifications` - Toggles sending of steam notifications when starting/stopping recordings, and other events. (EXPERIMENTAL!)
<br></br>

<br></br>

<br></br>

<br></br>

## BeatRecorder not connecting?

**AVG Antivirus is known to cause all kinds of issues** with connection-related things. (Credit to `Arro#6969` to help me discover this issue! <3)

If you have AVG Antivirus installed, please uninstall it and find a better antivirus solution.

If you ruled out your antivirus (through uninstalling it or deactivating it's protection), just create an issue or join my Discord like mentioned before.

## Notable differences between beatsaber-http-status and BSDataPuller

Any difference that affects the way BeatRecorder works will be documented here. Found more differences? You can create an issue with a detailed description.

* Accuracy Calculation with BSDataPuller is based in your current progress instead of the whole song
* `<levelid>` uses the LevelHash instead of the ID

## Contributing or forking

It should be as easy as cloning the repository and running `dotnet restore`.
